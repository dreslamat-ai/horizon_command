# horizon_command_rail.js is the ONLY static JavaScript in this app, and —
# same as horizon_theme's equivalent file — it never reads Frappe-internal
# data (no workspace list, no boot info, no route state): it only toggles a
# class on <html>, reads the one CSS custom property the settings endpoint
# above sets for it (--h-rail-default-collapsed), and listens for generic
# click events. See the file's own header comment for the full reasoning.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Website / portal pages (/login, /me, error pages). Desk assets above do NOT
# load here — Frappe serves web pages through a separate bundle — so the
# login screen needs its own small stylesheet, and the SAME live settings
# endpoint (it's allow_guest=True for exactly this reason).
